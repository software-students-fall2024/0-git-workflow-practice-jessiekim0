# Git workflow practice

I found [this article] (https://www.developer-tech.com/news/how-low-code-and-no-code-platforms-impact-traditional-development/) on low-code and no-code platforms interesting. 

## Summary
Tools like Mendix and Microsoft PowerApps reduce the amount of manual coding in creating applications, while no-code platforms like Bubble and FlutterFlow enable users to develop apps with virtually no prior coding experience at all. Despite potentially reducing costs for businesses, drawbacks include the compromised quality and scalability of the produced applications. Businesses may also need to check that the applications follow the company's security protocols or compliance regulations. 

## Reflection 
While these platforms offer a solution to creating basic applications for the general public, I do not think the job of software engineering will become obsolete. Firstly, people will be needed to maintain the software of such low-code and no-code platforms. Furthermore, because these applications operate by having users select from premade templates, projects that require a greater degree of customization or complexity in specifications cannot be developed in these environments. However, the article notes that the tool can be integrated into the workflow of experienced developers who want to prioritize more complicated tasks and automate the others. In other words, these tools will most likely be integrated as a complement, rather than replacement, to traditional software development.
